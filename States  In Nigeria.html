        <h3 style="text-align: center;">New York AG James Sues PepsiCo Over Plastic Pollution Along Buffalo River</h3>
        <p> <br>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against food and beverage giant PepsiCo Inc. accusing the company of harming the public and the environment with its single-use plastic packaging. <br>

            Ms. James's office announced the "historic and groundbreaking" lawsuit in a Nov. 15 press release, after PepsiCo's single-use plastics were allegedly found floating along the Buffalo River. <br>
            
            The lawsuit was filed in Buffalo, New York, and lists PepsiCo and its subsidiaries, Frito-Lay Inc. and Frito-Lay North America Inc., as defendants. It states that Ms. James's office found that single-use plastic—including beverage bottles, bottle caps, and snack food wrappers—produced by the beverage corporation "contributes significantly" to high levels of plastic pollution found along the Buffalo River, which empties into Lake Erie, and that such pollution is contaminating drinking water and harming wildlife. <br>

            According to the lawsuit, Ms. James's office conducted a survey of all types of waste collected at 13 sites along the Buffalo River and its tributaries in 2022. <br>
            
            Officials with her office collected a total of 1,916 pieces of plastic trash with an identifiable brand, of which 328, or 17.1 percent, were produced by PepsiCo; meaning it far exceeded any other source of the identifiable plastic waste found along the river and was three times more abundant than the next highest contributor.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Sunak battles Supreme Court ruling: What next for the UK’s Rwanda plan?</h3>
        <p>Hours after the United Kingdom’s Supreme Court ruled that the government’s plan to send asylum seekers to the African country was unlawful, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to introduce emergency legislation that confirms that Rwanda is a safe country. <br>

            The emergency legislation “will ensure that people cannot further delay flights by bringing systemic challenges in our domestic courts, and stop our policy being repeatedly blocked,” Sunak told reporters on Wednesday. The announcement came as human rights groups celebrated the Supreme Court decision, stating that asylum seekers would be at “risk of ill-treatment” if sent back to their home countries, once in Rwanda. <br>

            A joint civil society statement signed by 140 organisations, including prominent campaign groups such as the Runnymede Trust and Liberty, had described the plan as “cruel and immoral”. <br>
            
            “We urge the Government to immediately abandon such plans with Rwanda or with any other country, and instead protect the rights of people who have come to our country in search of sanctuary,” it said. <br>
            
            Maddie Harris, founder of the UK-based Humans for Rights Network – which also signed the statement, said the Supreme Court had made it “abundantly clear that Rwanda causes a serious risk to individuals in terms of refoulement to countries where they may face persecution or death”. <br>
            
            “An emergency law does not eliminate that risk. What the [UK] government is saying is: ‘We don’t care if we send people back to their death,’” she told Al Jazeera. <br>
            
            Harris said it was unclear how an emergency law could take precedence over a Supreme Court ruling.
